# ft_printf - 42 Project

This project involves recreating a simplified version of the `printf` function from the C standard library. The objective is to practice using variadic functions and to gain a deeper understanding of how formatted output works in C.

## ðŸ“„ About the Project

The goal of this project is to implement a custom version of the `printf` function. It will handle various format specifiers such as integers, strings, characters, and others. This project will deepen your understanding of variadic functions, which allow functions to accept an arbitrary number of arguments.

### Key Learning Outcomes:
- Understanding how variadic arguments work in C.
- Building a simplified version of the `printf` function.
- Managing memory and handling different data types efficiently.
- Writing functions that handle various formatting specifiers like `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Usage

### Requirements
- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C libraries

### Instructions

#### 1. Compiling the Library

To compile the `ft_printf` library, navigate to the directory containing the source files and run the following command:

```bash
$ make
